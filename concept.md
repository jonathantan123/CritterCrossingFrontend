*1. Must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Rails API backend. These should live in two separate repositories. All interactions between the client and the server should be handled asynchronously (AJAX).*

--> Ok, cool

*2. Must render out a resource with at least one has-many relationship (that's two resources total) in the JSON.For example, if we were building Instagram, we might display a list of photos with associated comments. Both resources should be editable.*

--> The road has many cars?

*3. Must use your Rails API and a form generated by the client to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh. For example, if you create a new Photo post, and form data would be serialized, and submitted via an AJAX POST request, with the response being the new object in JSON and then appending that new photo to the DOM using JavaScript (ES6 Template Literals, can help out a lot with this).*

--> The user will have to select frog avatar and difficulty level, which will set attributes of the Frog and the card's speed
